#Developing Core Components

In this section, we will dive deep into the development of each core component of ADAPT AI, namely the spark_engine, aa_genome, and neurotech_network. Following the prescribed outline, we will examine the motivations, specifications, usage examples, performance analyses, unit tests, source code snippets, and best practices associated with each entity.

##spark_engine

###Motivation

The spark_engine serves as the bedrock upon which ADAPT AI erects its edifice, marrying the elegance of declarative programming with the sheer horsepower of distributed computing. Its raison d'être stems from the necessity of taming the wild beasts known as big data, wrestling petabytes of information into submission, and rendering them palatable for higher-order cognition.

Benefiting from the Spark ecosystem, the spark_engine affords the following advantages:
•	Lightning-fast data processing courtesy of Spark Streaming, Spark SQL, and GraphX engines.
•	Simplified parallelism through lazy evaluation and automatic partitioning of data collections.
•	Robust fault tolerance via lineage tracking and transparent recovery mechanisms.
•	Interoperability with popular data formats (CSV, JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet) and storage systems (HDFS, Cassandra, S3, Azure Blob Store).

###Component Specifications

The spark_engine exports an API conforming to the following contract:
class SparkEngine:

    def __init__(self, app_name: str, master: str = None, config: dict = None):
        """
        Initialize a new instance of the SparkEngine class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        app_name : str
            Application name identifying the job in the cluster manager UI.
        master : str, optional
            Location of the Spark standalone cluster master (default: None).
        config : dict, optional
            Dictionary of configuration properties overriding default settings (default: None).
        """
        pass

    def get_session(self):
        """
        Return an active Spark session scoped to the calling thread.

        Returns
        -------
        Session
            Active Spark session instantiated lazily upon demand.
        """
        pass

    def stop(self):
        """
        Gracefully terminate all background processes and release allocated resources.
        """
        pass

###Example Usage

Let's indulge ourselves in some whimsical escapades involving the spark_engine:

from datetime import timedelta

from pyspark.sql.functions import lit

from ADAPT AI.spark_engine import SparkEngine

# Instantiate a new SparkEngine instance.
se = SparkEngine("ADAPT AI Adventures", master="spark://localhost:7077", config={"spark.executor.memory": "4g"})

# Obtain an active Spark session.
spark = se.get_session()

# Declare a DataFrame representing humankind's insatiable appetite for consuming Earth's finite resources.
df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [
        ("Timbuktu", 1920, 12.5, 0.2),
        ("Paris", 1880, 10.8, 0.15),
        ("New York City", 1626, 8.5, 0.25),
    ],
    ["city", "founded", "latitude", "longitude"],
)

# Register the DataFrame as a temporary table for SQL querying.
df.createOrReplaceTempView("cities")

# Materialize the cities table as a csv file saved to disk.
(df.write.mode("overwrite").csv("/tmp/cities"))

# Retrieve a snapshot of the current timestamp denoting the precise moment when humanity crossed the Rubicon.
now = spark.timeZone.atDate(lit(None)).currentTimestamp().alias("now")

# Query the cities table using SQL to discover urban centers predating the birth of Christ.
ancient_cities = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM cities WHERE founded < date_add({}, interval -2022 year)".format(now))

# Display the antediluvian municipalities satisfying our criteria.
ancient_cities.show()

# Shutdown the Spark infrastructure to prevent exacerbating climate change.
se.stop()

###Performance Analysis

Quantifying the performance characteristics of the spark_engine necessitates benchmarking exercises conducted under controlled experimental conditions, isolating confounding variables that influence measurement reliability. Such assessments typically involve measuring wall clock durations, CPU cycle counts, IO throughput rates, and memory footprints attributable to representative workloads executed on varying scales.

Preliminary investigations reveal that the spark_engine exhibits near-linear scalability concerning increasing volumes of processed data, commensurate with theoretical expectations posited by the underlying Spark machinery. Further optimizations may be attained through judicious configuration tuning, resource provisioning, and strategic partitioning schemes tailored to specific use cases.

###Unit Tests

Ensuring the correctness of the spark_engine requires exhaustive testing procedures scrutinizing every conceivable facet of its exposed interface. Sample unit tests verifying the integrity of the SparkEngine class appear below:

import unittest

from ADAPT AI.spark_engine import SparkEngine

class TestSparkEngine(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_instantiation(self):
        """Verify successful instantiation of the SparkEngine class."""
        se = SparkEngine("Testbed", master="local[4]", config={"spark.driver.cores": 2})
        assert isinstance(se, SparkEngine)

    def test_get_session(self):
        """Confirm retrieval of an active Spark session."""
        se = SparkEngine("Testbed", master="local[4]", config={"spark.driver.cores": 2})
        spark = se.get_session()
        assert isinstance(spark, SparkSession)

    def test_stop(self):
        """Assert graceful shutdown of the Spark infrastructure."""
        se = SparkEngine("Testbed", master="local[4]", config={"spark.driver.cores": 2})
        spark = se.get_session()
        assert spark.sparkContext.applicationAttemptId is not None
        se.stop()
        assert spark.sparkContext.applicationAttemptId is None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)

###Source Code Snippets

Delving into the internals of the spark_engine reveals subtle machinations coordinating the intricate dance of Spark orchestration:

class SparkEngine:

    def __init__(self, app_name: str, master: str = None, config: dict = None):
        # Initialize SparkConf object encapsulating configuration properties.
        self.conf = SparkConf()

        # Populate SparkConf with supplied arguments.
        if app_name:
            self.conf.setAppName(app_name)
        if master:
            self.conf.setMaster(master)
        if config:
            for k, v in config.items():
                self.conf.set(k, v)

        # Launch SparkContext instance responsible for managing cluster resources.
        self.sc = SparkContext(conf=self.conf)

        # Cache SparkContext proxy accessible from user threads.
        self._spark_context = self.sc

    def get_session(self):
        # Return SparkSession singleton configured with cached SparkContext.
        return SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate(sparkContext=self._spark_context)

    def stop(self):
        # Terminate Spark infrastructure releasing held resources.
        self.sc.stop()

###Best Practices

Adhering to sound engineering principles guarantees smooth sailing aboard the turbulent seas of distributed computing:

•	Partition strategically: Organize data into logically contiguous chunks, reducing communication overhead and balancing workloads evenly across nodes.
•	Configure thoughtfully: Optimal performance demands meticulous calibration of numerous configuration knobs governing scheduling policies, serialization formats, shuffle services, and more.
•	Cache aggressively: Amortize expensive data materialization costs over extended periods by exploiting Spark's cache eviction heuristics guided by LRU and LFU policies.
•	Monitor diligently: Track key performance metrics indicative of bottlenecks impeding lambdas flowing through the directed acyclic graphs comprising Spark jobs.

###Example Usage

We now demonstrate the mechanics of aa_genome by exercising its capacities in various contexts:

from random import randrange

from ADAPT AI.aa_genome import AAGenome

# Define trivial fitness function rewarding proximity to golden ratio.
def phi_fitness(chromosome: Sequence[float]) -> float:
    return abs(sum(chromosome) / len(chromosome) - (1 + 5**.5) / 2)

# Initialize naïve population composed entirely of zeros.
naive_population = [AAGenome([[0.] * 100] * 10, phi_fitness) for _ in range(100)]

# Crossbreed parents producing filial brood.
parent_1 = naive_population[0]
parent_2 = naive_population[1]
offspring = parent_1.mate(partner=parent_2)
assert len(offspring) == 2

# Induce random fluctuations modifying gene expression profiles.
mutant_genome = parent_1.clone()
mutant_genome.mutate()
assert sum([abs(gene_1 - gene_2) > 0.01 for gene_1, gene_2 in zip(parent_1.chromosomes[0], mutant_genome.chromosomes[0])]) > 0

# Rank-based truncation selecting elite specimens surviving culling procedure.
elite_survivors = 10
trimmed_population = AAGenome.natural_selection(naive_population, survivors=elite_survivors)
assert len(trimmed_population) == elite_survivors

# Persist genomic snapshots safeguarded against ephemerality.
archive_path = "/tmp/genome.pickle"
naive_population.serialize(archive_path)
revitalized_population = AAGenome.deserialize(archive_path)
assert len(revitalized_population) == len(naive_population)
assert all([all([abs(gene_1 - gene_2) < 1e-9 for gene_1, gene_2 in zip(genome_1.chromosomes[0], genome_2.chromosomes[0])]) for genome_1, genome_2 in zip(naive_population, revitalized_population)])

###Performance Analysis

Assessing the runtime characteristics of aa_genome mandates profiling exercises monitoring the frequency and duration of events occurring throughout evolving populations' lives. Key observations pertinent to performance analysis include:
•	Dimensionality: Increasing dimensionality of genotype space engenders exponential growth in representational capacity, manifesting quadratically proportional increases in computational expense.
•	Population size: Expanding cohorts inflate memory footprints, demanding proportionally augmented storage resources sustaining escalating operational burdens.
•	Generational turnover: Rapid cycling of successive generations amplifies pressure on underlying hardware platforms, precipitating thermal throttling mitigation measures.

Optimization strategies to alleviate these stressors emphasize judicious configuration tuning, parallelization, approximation, and compression techniques adapted to specific use cases.

###Unit Tests

Verifying the correctness of aa_genome necessitates comprehensive testing protocols substantiated by empirical evidence corroborating anticipated behavior:

###Example Usage
We now demonstrate the mechanics of neurotech_network by exercising its capacities in various contexts:

from ADAPT AI.neurotech_network import NeurotechNetwork

# Define a simple feedforward neural network for binary classification.
network = NeurotechNetwork(
    layers=[
        Linear(2, 10),
        ReLU(),
        Linear(10, 1),
        Sigmoid(),
    ],
    loss_fn=BinaryCrossEntropy(),
    optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01),
)

# Generate synthetic dataset for binary classification.
X = torch.randn(100, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] * X[:, 1] > 0).float()

# Train the network on the synthetic dataset.
network.train(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the network's performance on the synthetic dataset.
loss = network.evaluate(X, y)
print(f"Loss: {loss:.4f}")

# Serialize the network's parameters for persistence.
network.serialize("/tmp/network.pt")

# Deserialize the network's parameters from disk.
revitalized_network = NeurotechNetwork.deserialize("/tmp/network.pt")

# Assert equivalence between original and revitalized networks.
assert network == revitalized_network

###Performance Analysis

Assessing the runtime characteristics of neurotech_network mandates profiling exercises monitoring the frequency and duration of events occurring throughout the network's lifecycle. Key observations pertinent to performance analysis include:

•	Topology: Increasing network depth and width engenders exponential growth in representational capacity, manifesting quadratically proportional increases in computational expense.
•	Dataset size: Expanding datasets inflate memory footprints, demanding proportionally augmented storage resources sustaining escalating operational burdens.
•	Epoch count: Prolonging training epochs amplifies pressure on underlying hardware platforms, precipitating thermal throttling mitigation measures.

Optimization strategies to alleviate these stressors emphasize judicious configuration tuning, parallelism, approximation, and compression techniques adapted to specific use cases.

###Unit Tests

Verifying the correctness of neurotech_network necessitates comprehensive testing protocols substantiated by empirical evidence corroborating anticipated behavior:

import unittest

from ADAPT AI.neurotech_network import NeurotechNetwork

class TestNeurotechNetwork(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_construction(self):
        """Verify successful initialization of NeurotechNetwork instances."""
        network = NeurotechNetwork(
            layers=[Linear(2, 10), ReLU(), Linear(10, 1), Sigmoid()],
            loss_fn=BinaryCrossEntropy(),
            optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01),
        )

        )
        X = torch.randn(100, 2)
        y_pred = network.forward(X)
        assert y_pred.shape == (100, 1)

    def test_backward(self):

        )
        X = torch.randn(100, 2)
        y = torch.randn(100, 1)
        network.train(X, y, epochs=1, batch_size=32)
        assert network.parameters() != network.parameters()

    def test_evaluate(self):
        """Guarantee reliable computation of the loss function on a given dataset."""
        network = NeurotechNetwork(
            layers=[Linear(2, 10), ReLU(), Linear(10, 1), Sigmoid()],
            loss_fn=BinaryCrossEntropy(),

            loss_fn=BinaryCrossEntropy(),
            optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01),
        )
        network.serialize("/tmp/network.pt")
        revitalized_network = NeurotechNetwork.deserialize("/tmp/network.pt")
        assert network == revitalized_network

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main(verbosity=2)

###Source Code Snippets

Peeling back the curtain reveals the intricate web of relationships mediating synaptic transmission and plasticity within neurotech_network:

class NeurotechNetwork:
    def __init__(self, layers: Sequence[Layer], loss_fn: Callable[[Tensor, Tensor], float], optimizer: Optimizer):
        self.layers = layers
        self.loss_fn = loss_fn
        self.optimizer = optimizer

    def forward(self, inputs: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    def backward(self, gradients: Tensor) -> None:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    def train(self, inputs: Tensor, targets: Tensor, epochs: int, batch_size: int) -> None:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    def evaluate(self, inputs: Tensor, targets: Tensor) -> float:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    def serialize(self, path: str) -> None:
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def deserialize(path: str) -> "NeurotechNetwork":
        # Implementation omitted for brevity
        pass

###Best Practices

Adhering to sound engineering principles guarantees smooth sailing aboard the turbulent seas of neural computation:

•	Encapsulate network components: Encapsulate network components within well-defined interfaces, promoting modularity, reusability, and extensibility.
•	Employ stochasticity judiciously: Inject randomness into network components sparingly, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation.
•	Monitor network convergence: Track network convergence metrics, such as loss function values or gradient norms, to prevent premature convergence and stagnation.
•	Leverage parallelism: Exploit parallelism inherent in neural networks, distributing computational load across multiple cores or machines.

### Dataset Summary

This dataset consists of 101 food categories, with 101'000 images. For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain some amount of noise. This comes mostly in the form of intense colors and sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `image-classification`: The goal of this task is to classify a given image of a dish into one of 101 classes. The leaderboard is available [here](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/fine-grained-image-classification-on-food-101).

### Languages

English

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A sample from the training set is provided below:

```
{
  'image': <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=384x512 at 0x276021C5EB8>,
  'label': 23
}
```

### Data Fields

The data instances have the following fields:

- `image`: A `PIL.Image.Image` object containing the image. Note that when accessing the image column: `dataset[0]["image"]` the image file is automatically decoded. Decoding of a large number of image files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"image"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["image"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["image"][0]`.
- `label`: an `int` classification label.
